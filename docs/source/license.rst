The SQL accessor functionality in SuperPandas is inspired by and builds upon concepts from the `pandasql <https://github.com/yhat/pandasql>`_ project, which is also licensed under the MIT License. We acknowledge and thank the pandasql contributors for their work.

The pandasql project provides SQL querying capabilities for pandas DataFrames and has been a valuable reference for implementing similar functionality in SuperPandas. The original pandasql project can be found at: https://github.com/yhat/pandasql
